# 本周作业
## 题目一（10分）
根据你常用的语言，任选一题：

- 假如你将入职阿里巴巴，请根据阿里巴巴的Java代码规范对`unformatted`中的Java代码进行规范化。要求写出你在IDEA中操作的主要步骤。
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)和[isort](https://readthedocs.org/projects/isort/)是对Python代码规范化的常用工具。请使用这两个包对`unformatted.py`进行规范化。要求写出操作的主要步骤。

## 题目二（5分）
任选下面两条敏捷开发原则，翻译成中文：

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
